= Deploying from git

Instead of running the installer, which installs a released version of Drogue Cloud, you can also directly from the
repository, using `:latest` images instead. The same way, you can also deploy your custom-built images. This is useful if you have made changes to the Drogue Cloud source code and want to test them out, or if you want to use some feature that has not yet been released.

[IMPORTANT]
.`main` and tagged versions
====
Deploying from the repository implies that you install `latest` or `main`. Even when you check out a tag or branch from
the repository, this will always install `latest`. If you want to install a tagged version, use the installer.
====

== Additional pre-requisites

Additionally, you will need to:

* `git`
* Clone the `drogue-cloud` repository

== Deploy standard images

Installing Drogue Cloud, using the standard images, can be done by calling the makefile target `deploy`:

[source,bash]
----
make deploy
----

== Deploy custom images

If you built custom images, and pushed them to a container repository, you can deploy them using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
make CONTAINER_REGISTRY=quay.io/my-repo build images
----

You can install them using:

[source,bash]
----
make CONTAINER_REGISTRY=quay.io/my-repo deploy
----

== Using the installer script for development

The makefile actually uses the installer script `scripts/drgadm` internally. It only passes in the right arguments,
so that the installer will install images from a different registry, or use a different tag.

NOTE: By default, the installer scripts, even on the main branch, will install a tagged version. Sometimes tagged
versions are not yet available on the container registry, and thus, the installation may fail. It is therefore
recommended to install "latest" images using the `make deploy` command.
