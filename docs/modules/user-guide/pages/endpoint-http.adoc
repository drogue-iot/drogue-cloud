= HTTP protocol endpoint

The HTTP protocol endpoint is a device facing service offering connectivity using different HTTP based APIs.

The base address of the HTTP protocol endpoints depends on your installation. For a local, test installation, this
is mostly based on the IP address and uses `nip.io` to resolve this as a DNS name. Assuming your IP address is `1.2.3.4`
the hostname would be `http-endpoint.1.2.3.4.nip.io`.

== Default HTTP API

Drogue Cloud offers a default HTTP API for connecting devices to the cloud. In addition to that, other HTTP APIs may
exist, implementing other IoT like APIs, see the following sections for more information.

==== Authentication

You need to use one of the following authentication mechanisms:

[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
|Information | Details

| X.509 Client certificate | Provide an X.509 client certificate during the TLS handshake. The certificate must be signed with a trust anchor stored in the device registry on the application level.

| TLS-PSK | Provide a pre-shared key during the TLS handshake. See xref:management.adoc#_setting_tls_psk_credentials[Setting TLS-PSK credentials] for how to configure the device.

a| * Credentials: `<username>@<application>:<password>`
| Standard username/password authentication using `<username>@<application>` as HTTP username. The `<username>` can
either be a device name, device alias, or unique username.

a|* Credentials: `<username>:<password>`
* Query: `application=<application>`
| Use a standard username and provide the application as part of the HTTP query. The `<username>` can
either be a device name, device alias, or unique username.

a|* Credentials: `<username>@<password>`
* Query: `application=<application>&device=<device>`
| Use a non-unique username, provide application and device using query parameters.

|X
|The name of the channel to send to

|`application`
|string
|query
|
|Override the application for authentication. See above.

|`device`
|string
|query
|
|Override the device for authentication. See above.

|`as`
|string
|query
|
|Allows to specify an alternate device name that this device may act on behalf of. The "as" device must be configured to
allow the authenticated device (from the credentials or `device`) to act on its behalf.

|`ct`
|integer
|query
|
|
|Number of seconds the endpoint should wait for a command, for returning to the device from the cloud side.
