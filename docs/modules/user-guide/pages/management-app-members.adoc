= Application sharing

Application owners can share their applications with another users.
Drogue Cloud defines several roles that can be given to the users.
By default, an application have only an owner and no users to it's member list.

== Members roles

- Reader : This is the most basic level: read only access.
- Manager: allows read and write access to the application. This include the reader role as well.
- Administrator: This role allows to manage the members of the application, deleting the application, plus the above roles.

| Consume application events stream   | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️
| read application details            | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️
| edit application details            | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️
| create and edit devices             | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️
| delete devices                      | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️
| Edit application details            | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️
| Delete application                  | ❌ | ❌ | ✔️
| Edit application members            | ❌ | ❌ | ✔️

|===

The roles are defined per-application, so someone can be administrator for an application and reader for another.

NOTE: If you wish to share your application to the whole world you can add a role to the anonymous user. In Drogue Cloud, the user name to use is an empty string : "".


== Add users to an application

There are two ways to manage application members: through the "Administration" tab in the console (from the application details page), or with drg.

Here we'll show a few examples unsing drg:

Add a reader and an administrator:
[bash, source]
-----
drg add member <username> --role reader --app <AppId>
drg add member <anotheruser> --role admin --app <AppId>
-----
NOTE: With drg, `member` and `members` can be used interchangeably.

Remove a member :
[bash, source]
----
drg delete member <username> --app <AppId>
----

You can also edit the members object with : `drg edit member` and make changes manually.
Finally, drg can list members for an application with `drg get members`.

NOTE: A user can be defined once in an application's members list.

== Application ownership

The owner hae the same rights as the "admin" role, with the added ability to transfer the ownership to another user.

To initiate an ownership transfer, you can go to the "Administration" tab in the console, or use drg:
[bash, source]
----
drg transfer init <username> --app <AppId>
----

The receiving user can acccept the transer with:
[bash, source]
----
drg transfer accept <appId>
----

The owner of an application stays the owner until the transfer is accepted by another user. It is possible to cancel an initated (but not completed) transfer with :
[bash, source]
----
drg transfer cancel <appId>
----
