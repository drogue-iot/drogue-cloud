= Monitoring the deployment

== Deploying

Specifying `-M` during installation process will install Prometheus and Grafana allowing you to monitor your deployment.

You can do that both using installer:

[source,shell]
----
./script/drgadm deploy -M
----

Or during development:

[source,bash]
----
env DEPLOY_ARGS="-M" make deploy
----

== Using

You can find out the URL of the dashboard by running the `drgadm` script:

[source,bash]
----
env METRICS=true scripts/drgadm examples
----

It should print something like:

[source,bash]
----
View the metrics dashboard:
----------------------------

* Login to Grafana: https://metrics.192.168.64.131.nip.io
* Default credentials are 'admin/admin123456' if not configured differently
----

== Configuring

You can set values of the `drogue-cloud-metrics` Helm chart in order to configure various aspects of its deployment.

For example, the following will

[source,shell]
----
./script/drgadm deploy -M -s drogueCloudMetrics.grafana.adminPassword=654321nimda
----

will change the password for accessing Grafana dashboard.
