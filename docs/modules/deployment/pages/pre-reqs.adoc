= Pre-requisites

Deploying Drogue Cloud, you will need a few tools on your local machine. In most cases a Linux/Unix environment
is assumed, which includes Mac OS X.

== Command line tools

* `drg`- aka https://github.com/drogue-iot/drg[Drogue command line client]
* `http` - aka https://httpie.org/[HTTPie]
* `mqtt` - aka https://github.com/hivemq/mqtt-cli[MQTT CLI]
* `kubectl` - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
* `helm` – https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm CLI]
* `podman` or `docker` – Both work, also in rootless mode.
+
NOTE: For `podman` you need to also set an alias for `docker` to `podman`

== Kubernetes Cluster

You will need a Kubernetes cluster in order to deploy Drogue Cloud.

In general, any Kubernetes cluster should work. However, we mostly test with:

* Minikube – https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
* Kind – https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/
* OpenShift or OKD – https://www.openshift.com/ or https://www.okd.io/
